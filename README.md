Project aim: To classify age, gender, and race from facial images using deep convolutional neural networks with transfer learning.
Plan:
<li> Compare several deep architectures for all classifications. </li>
<li> Investigate whether subsetting facial images based on gender and race enhances the accuracy of the age group classification.</li>
